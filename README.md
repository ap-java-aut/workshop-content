# java workshop

## Introduction

This project is dedicated to teaching an advanced programming course in Java. The course starts with the fundamentals 
and gradually covers more complex topics. Along the way, we also explore essential tools like Git, IntelliJ, and other 
technologies that are part of a Java programmer's daily workflow.

## Quera

This course is offered to students through [Quera](https://quera.org).  
Here are the links to access the Quera page for each semester:

## Repo Structure

**template:** Here is the template we use for our documents. We use the 'Estedad' font for these, 
and the font file is located right next to the template.

**workshop:** The main content is located here. The content for each week is organized into separate directories, 
starting from Week 0 (don’t ask why). Each week’s content is split into two directories:
- **ta:** This directory contains answers to the week’s problems or projects, editable .docx files, and everything 
the teaching assistants need but the students don't.
- **student:** This directory holds content intended for students, including PDF files of documents, project templates, 
assignments, videos, and everything they need to complete the work for that week. Also, there's a README.md file,
which outlines that week's learning process for students.

**guideline**: Here are the guidelines to ensure high-quality content in this workshop. 

**project**: Different projects assigned to the students

## TA contribution

Create a branch from `main`, then submit a pull request to merge it. If you're working in a group, everyone should use 
the same branch. Please avoid creating multiple branches in the repository for a single week. use kebab-case for your 
branch name. Also, Don't forget to provide a README.md file for the students.

Before writing a new document, carefully read the instructions provided in [how-to-write-a-good-doc](guideline/how-to-write-a-good-doc.pdf).

## Conventions

Use kebab-case for everything! Apply kebab-case to directory names, files, and similar items, unless there's a more 
common convention that specifies otherwise. use imperative verbs in the present tense for your commit messages, and 
write them in all lowercase.
